        "For this project I examined the Austin, Texas Airbnb data about prices, the types of rentals, and the reviews they got. In this project I created visualizations of the most popular areas to rent, the type of house, the amount of bathrooms, the amount of bedrooms, the year the host joined Airbnb, and the minimum and maximum nights to stay. After that I performed a KNN Regression model to predict the price, a neural network to predict whether a host is good or not, and a text analysis on reviews. Below are my target grades and I attempted to achieve the high target. \n",
        "### Low Target: To be able to achieve C level work I would need to do one of the data analysis approaches I talked about, one of the visualizations, and not clean the data of null values. \n",
        "### Medium Target: To be able to achieve B level work I would need to do all of the visualizations besides the challenge one I set out for myself, I would need to do both the text analysis and the KKN model but not develop the neural network, and I would need to have cleaned all of the data of null values. \n",
        "### High Target: To be able to achieve A level work I need to complete all of model and text analysis, all of the visualizations that I have described, and to have cleaned all of the data. A level work means exceeding what you set out to do which means that all of my models should have high accuracies and my visualizations should be clear and understandable. A level work also means throwing in more of challenge for yourself, for this project it might be creating a cluster model of the location of the homes or a SNA of the location of the homes. \n"

This goes along with the most common words used, as you can see 'great' was clearly used more than any other word and their was only a few negative words. "

        "Conclusion: The biggest challenge with this project was the text analysis part of this work. I originally was trying to do the text analysis part of this without using NLTK, this lead to problems of having multiple numbers in the words and the words not being stemmed. I had to figure out through online tutorials how to implemeant NLTK text analysis for a dataframe which lead to the most of my troubles. The quality of my results are that the visualizations are clear with no overlapping text or hard to read charts and every model achieved what it set out to do. Two ways I could try and improve my model would be to try and get a better result for my KNN regression model and to get a more clear output for the text analysis portion of my project. I believed I achieved the high target A range for this project, I completed everything I set out to do and in the high target range for my project I said that to achieve an A I had to do a challenge for myself and I believe implementing NLTK text analysis was a challenge that I acheived.
